# OSChat
zero-configuration chat for entertainment networks, with integrated OSC messaging

## Overview

OSChat will provide zero-configuration party line and direct text messaging on entertainment networks, including networks that lack traditional routing by dynamically turning ordinary entertainment computers into mesh gateways as required. Automatic discovery of nodes and users will allow you to see exactly who is on the network at any time. Zero configuration means *zero* configuration. Backwards compatibility with [TheatreChat](https://docs.sidechainsoftware.com/theatrechat/) clients will be maintained whenever feasible.

Cross-platform support in the reference implementation including native cli and webgui interfaces will be provided with [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) - additional native clients are welcomed and encouraged.
